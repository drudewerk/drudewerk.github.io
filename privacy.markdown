Effective Date: 01.11.2024

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy outlines the practices of the JSON Import & Export by Drudewerk Add-On ("Add-On") regarding the collection, use, and protection of your information. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to ensuring that your personal data is protected.

## Data Collection and Use

The JSON Import & Export by Drudewerk Add-On is designed to enhance your experience with Google Sheets by allowing you to import and export JSON files. Importantly, the Add-On does **not** store any user data. 

### Data Processing

- **User Data Access**: The Add-On processes data only with your explicit permission. This includes data from JSON files you choose to import or export while using the Add-On.
- **No Storage**: We do not retain any data or personal information after your session ends. All data processed by the Add-On is handled in real time and is not stored on our servers.

## User Control

You have full control over the data you share with the Add-On:

- **Import and Export**: The Add-On will only access the data you allow when you choose to import JSON files or export data to JSON format.
- **Permissions**: The Add-On requests permissions necessary to function, and you can revoke these permissions at any time through your Google account settings.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

# Privacy Policy
##### For JSON Import & Export by Drudewerk Add-On for Google Sheets™

Effective Date: 01.11.2024

# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy outlines the practices of the JSON Import & Export by Drudewerk Add-On ("Add-On") regarding the collection, use, and protection of your information. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to ensuring that your personal data is protected.

## Data Collection and Use

The JSON Import & Export by Drudewerk Add-On is designed to enhance your experience with Google Sheets™ by allowing you to import and export JSON files. Importantly, the Add-On does **not** store any user data. 

### Data Processing

- **User Data Access**: The Add-On processes data only with your explicit permission. This includes data from JSON files you choose to import or export while using the Add-On.
- **No Storage**: We do not retain any data or personal information after your session ends. All data processed by the Add-On is handled in real time and is not stored on our servers.

## Google User Data Access

The Add-On accesses Google user data solely for the purpose of interacting with Google Sheets™. Specifically, it accesses **Google Sheets content** to allow JSON data to be imported and exported to and from your sheets. No other Google user data is accessed or processed.

## How We Use Google User Data

The Google user data (i.e., content within Google Sheets™) is accessed strictly to perform the functions of the Add-On—namely, importing JSON data into Google Sheets™ or exporting Google Sheets™ content as a JSON file. We do not use your Google user data for any other purpose.

## Sharing, Transferring, or Disclosing Google User Data

We do not share, transfer, or disclose your Google user data to any third parties. All processing of Google data occurs locally within your session, and no data is stored or transmitted outside of the Add-On environment.

## Data Protection Mechanisms

We implement robust security measures to protect any sensitive data handled during your session, including:

- **No Data Retention**: Since we do not store data, there is no risk of retained information being accessed or leaked.
- **Encryption**: All interactions with Google Sheets™ are conducted over encrypted connections (HTTPS), ensuring that data remains secure while in transit.
- **User Control**: You retain full control over permissions, which can be managed and revoked at any time via your Google account settings.

## User Control

You have full control over the data you share with the Add-On:

- **Import and Export**: The Add-On will only access the data you allow when you choose to import JSON files or export data to JSON format.
- **Permissions**: The Add-On requests permissions necessary to function, and you can revoke these permissions at any time through your Google account settings.
